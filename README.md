# carousel-as-a-vue-componente

Welcome, vuers!

As the description says, this is a very simple component for vue that implements a carousel.

Bind "catalog" with an array of objects with the properties "label" and "src". Names are self-explanatory.

The "height" and "width" props are also easy to understand. Both accept CSS values.

"forceImageCover" is a boolean that forces images to cover the entire space of the component's viewport. Enabling this option may cause some distortion of the images you insert in the "catalog" prop.
